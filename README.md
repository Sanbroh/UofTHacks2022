# CheckIn
Built for UofTHacks 2022
</br>
# Inspiration
Our team firmly believes that one of the best ways to connect with others is through acts of service. Coming out of the pandemic, volunteers will be crucial to supporting those hit the hardest. Although many people often want to volunteer in their communities, their schedules are too variable to commit to a steady volunteer role. CheckIn solves this issue by “gig-ifying” volunteer work, connecting those looking to help with work whenever and wherever it is available.

# What it does
CheckIn is a web app that allows people who want to volunteer and help out within their community to connect with opportunities put forth by local organizations.

# What's next for CheckIn
In order to realize its vision of “gig-ified” volunteer work, CheckIn’s next steps include building iOS and Android applications to increase convenience for users. Additionally, CheckIn relies on a large network of users, both volunteers and volunteer opportunity organizers, in order to deliver its service. Its primary next step will be an advertising campaign and potential promotional period in order to boost its user base.
